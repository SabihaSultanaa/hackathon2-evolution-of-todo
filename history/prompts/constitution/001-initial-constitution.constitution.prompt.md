## Prompt

# Project Constitution: Todo CLI

## 1. Core Mandate
This project follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD). The AI (Claude) is the Developer; the User is the Architect.

## 2. Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.13+
- **Package Manager:** `uv`
- **Persistence:** In-memory storage only for Phase I.
- **Architecture:** Separation of concerns between CLI (UI) and Service (Logic).

## 3. Development Rules
- **No Manual Coding:** All code must be generated by the AI from Markdown specs.
- **PHR Requirement:** Every prompt from the user must be recorded verbatim in `history/prompts/`.
- **Atomic Changes:** Implement features one at a time.
- **Spec-First:** If a bug is found, update the Spec in the `/specs` folder first, then fix the code.

## 4. Phase I Objectives
- Implement: Add Task, List Tasks, Update Task, Delete Task, and Toggle Completion.
- Use unique IDs for all tasks.

## Response snapshot

Created project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:
- Six core principles (I-VI) defining SDD methodology
- Technical stack specification (Python 3.13+, uv, in-memory storage)
- Phase I objectives for core todo features
- Governance rules for compliance

Templates verified aligned: plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md, phr-template.prompt.md

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project governance established with SDD principles
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create feature specifications for Phase I features
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear mandate for spec-first development
